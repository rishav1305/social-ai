# Project Workspace

Welcome to the project. This workspace is configured with specific rules for AI-assisted development.

## Documentation

All detailed documentation is located in the **[`docs/`](./docs)** folder.

### Structure
- **[`docs/changelog/`](./docs/changelog)**: Records of changes, updates, and their impacts.
- **`docs/architecture/`**: System design and SOLID compliance.
- **`docs/api/`**: Reference documentation.

## development Guidelines

### Maintaining Documentation
1. **For Every Change**:
   - Create a new entry in `docs/changelog/` using the **[`TEMPLATE.md`](./docs/changelog/TEMPLATE.md)**.
   - Update relevant architecture or feature docs.
2. **Impact Analysis**: Explicitly state how a change affects existing features.

### Configuration
- See **[`.cursorrules`](./.cursorrules)** for Persona, Workflow, and Coding Standards.
